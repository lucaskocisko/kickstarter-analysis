# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This dataset shows a collection of Kickstarter campaigns for plays. The data gathered comes from around the globe and highlights different aspects of the campaign.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based On Launch Date
I’ve analyzed data on the theater category and constructed a graph to show the outcome based on launch date. The prime time for louise to put on her performance is the late spring early summer. In May there were nearly 3 times the number of successful plays than failed ones. The worst time would be the end of the year where in December the number was almost equal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I’ve constructed a second graph showing the relationship of the outcome and fundraising goal of the plays subcategory. After looking at the data, I can say only one thing for certain about the outcome of the play based on the goal. Rarely should a play look to raise >$40000 as the vast majority fail. I can suggest that Louise may find success with a budget of <$15000 or somewhere between 32-40k.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first graph wasn’t too difficult other than formatting the table and using the correct filters. Choosing which ranges to use in a table seem to take some trial and error. I had some trouble making the second table because I first used < instead of <= in my ranges. I missed several data points this way and my graph was incomplete. After filtering Sheet1 of the kickstarter data I found the missing data points.

## Results
Including a short summary, info on the goal, deadline, number of backers, and outcome; this dataset is relatively extensive. However it does have some limitations. This data set could be improved by widening its scope. With a bigger dataset we will get a clearer image of the picture. Some outliers may also want to be removed. If a plays goal is higher than 70k say, it could be removed to keep the data more realistic to louise. When I populated the variance and range table of my own Technology>Space Travel data, I didn’t have any failed data in some ranges. Where as louise is looking at hundreds of similar plays, I was only comparing 10s of similar media. I would want more data if I were looking to put on a different category. I think we should make a table showing the relationship between number of backers and outcome.
Performed analysis on global kickstarter campagins. Constructed tables and charts to show a deeper analysis on Great Britain musicals. If louise intends to have a successful musical she should aim to hold the event sometime during the summer.
